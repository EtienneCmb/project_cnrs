# Evolving Concepts of Functional Localization
Joseph B. McCaffrey, _Philosophy Compass_, 2023

---

## Highlights
---

> [!INFO]
> - The paper discusses the concept of #FunctionalLocalization  and how it evolved and changed over time
> - It summarizes three modern concepts, namely the #NeuralReuse , #NeuralDegeneracy and #Contextualism 
> - Might be time to abandon #Localizationism as the structure-function relationships might be really unstable


## History
---

- #Localizationism originates from 19th century (~1835) with Gall
- Wernicke believed in sensory / motor functions localized and higher-level cognition not localized
- #Connectionism believe in the mapping of brain functions on #Networks 

## Definitions
---

### Old school localizationism 

- #FunctionalLocalization : brain has "functionally distinct, physically discrete" areas
- #Equipotentialism : all cortical tissue can perform any cortex's function (continuous sheet)
- #Holism : most of the brain participates in any function

### Contemporary localizationism 

- #StructuralSpecialization : brain structures are specialized for a particular cognitive function ( #OneToOne mapping )
- #FunctionalLocalization : function localization is stable to a specific structure
- #Intrinsicality : function of neural structures can be understood in relative isolation

### Anti-localizationism

#### Neural reuse

- **Definition of** #NeuralReuse : cortical regions are recruited for multiple cognitive functions and hence are rarely specialized (*example :* a knife can cut a peach or a cherry)
- **Mapping :** #OneToMany 

> [!WARNING]
> brain areas have many functions at one level of description and different functions at another level of description

#### Neural degeneracy

- **Definition of** #NeuralDegeneracy : different brain regions can perform the same cognitive functions (or at least yield to the same output) under different circumstances (*example :* a knife and scissors can perform the same cutting action on a sheet of paper)
- **Mapping :** #ManyToOne 
- #NeuralDegeneracy $\neq$ #Redundancy because redundancy involves multiple copies of the same information

#### Contextualism


- **Definition of** #Contextualism : function of a neural structure depends on the broader "neural context" in which the structure is involved (e.g. a brain region can be scissors or a knife, depending on the context. For example, the  #Networks it is included in? )
- Basically, it is the opposite of #Intrinsicality (cognitive functions can be understood in isolation)
- Some have proposed that the contextualism depends on the structure : the might strongly depends on the context or not, which is not so far from Wernicke's conception.
