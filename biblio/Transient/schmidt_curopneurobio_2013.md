# Transient oscillations as computations for cognition: Analysis, modeling and function

---

- #Transient = short-lived events characterized by their rate, timing, duration, amplitude combined metrics such as volume

## Identification of transient oscillations
---

- #Transient disappear with averaging
- **Lagged coherence**: kind of correlation between non-overlapping time windows. This metric quantifies how long you can "predict" the phase f a signal. When there's a burst, it can not be predicted (kind of...)
- **Thresholding**: like #CracklingNoise , threshold the amplitude. Need to verify those events.
- **Hidden Markov Model**: detect states. Need to read more about this


## Computation mechanisms generating transient oscillations
---

- Model of #Transient activity:
	1. Oscillations can be generated by sustained excitatory inputs. Short period and strong input
	2. Oscillations are generated by recurrent connections between excitatory and inhibitory sub-populations. #Transient appear when the network operates at a regime slightly below oscillatory state [32, Demian's Nature paper]

## Functions of transient oscillations
---

- #Transient oscillations open communication channels between brain regions ( #CTC)
