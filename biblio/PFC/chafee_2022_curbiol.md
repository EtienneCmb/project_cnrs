1. dlPFC neurons are strongly involved in working memory
2. Humans with PFC damages have troubles in planning, they perseverate (i.e. difficulties in switching behaviors) and are distractibles
3. Encoding of items occurs in several brain regions of the PFC simultaneously, which means that encoding is a **network phenomenon**. Therefore, understanding how items are encoded doesn't implies to find every local encoding but instead, **how the encoding in one brain region can influence the encoding in another brain region**?
4. Going from the motor cortex to the frontal pole, there's a gradient where **more frontal regions are encoding more abstract information**.
