## Representation of task-relevant information in large scale network

[[@siegel2015cortical]] found that task-relevant information was present in all cortical areas, supporting the idea of **distributed information**. However, this study didn't investigate whether the **nature of the information carried** by the cortical regions was redundant (or synergistic)

## Revisiting the neuron doctrine

Neurons was supposed to be the encoding unit responding to unique features (Golgi, Barlow). The field shifted to the idea that neuronal assemblies are the encoding unit (Hebb) where the information is encoded in highly multi-dimensional space.

## Mixed selectivity and dynamic coding for flexible cognition

This idea of neuronal assemblies as the functional unit is also known as **population coding**. Single neurons are encoding a weighted sum of task-related components and isolated task-related features can be retrieved from the covariance between neurons. This also known as the **Mixed selectivity**. A second important concept is **dynamic coding** and relates to a population coding that change over time. **Population coding** allows a better cognitive flexibility and **dynamic coding** a better dynamic cognitive control (i.e. being able to change behavior in front of new evidences in a dynamic way)

## Prefrontal cortex depends on large scale networks

Oscillatory multiplexing supposed that the information is encoded / transmitted in different frequency bands like the radio FM  :

- **Delta / Theta** = memory formation
- **Alpha** = block irrelevant sensory information
- **Beta** = top-down (conscience, goal-directed behavior)
- **Gamma** = bottom-up
