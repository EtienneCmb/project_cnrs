## Highlights

[[@tremblay2022non]] found neural tuning in Monkey's PFC (8a) in four different task, but in three of them, 8a is not important in the final production of the behavior (previous studies used ablation). Hence, there's non-important activity in 8A.

Possible explanations :
- It's [debated](https://twitter.com/CamilleTestard/status/1570035115316871177) whether 8A is important or not in the three tasks. Maybe there's a neural tuning simply because 8A is involved in the task
- Maybe 8A is just representing inputs or outputs of other regions
