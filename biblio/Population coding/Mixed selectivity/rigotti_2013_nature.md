> [[@rigotti2013importance]] investigated how the mixed-selectivity of neurons in the PFC increases the proportion of accessible binary classifications compared to classical selectivity.

## Information encoding is distributed

Some neurons have a classical selectivity to individual task aspects while others are encoding a non-linear weighted sum of multiple task components. **Individual task aspects are therefore contained in the covariance between neurons while being absent at the single cell level**. This distributed information can then be decoded by readout neurons.

## Neural representations are highly-dimensional

The dimension is defined as the minimal number of coordinate axes to fully describe a population of neurons. Classical selectivity implies low-dimensional space while mixed-selectivity implies high-dimensional spaces. Highly dimensional spaces allow to encode more input-output relationships (=binary classifications). Dimensionality can be estimated by the number of binary classification that can be implemented by a linear classifier. The total number of implementable binary classification Nc is related to the dimensionality d : $d=log_{2}(Nc)$
