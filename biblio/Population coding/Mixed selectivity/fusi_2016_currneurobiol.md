> [[@fusi2016neurons]] provide methodological reasons why mixed selectivity is powerful for the flexibility of cognitive functions

## Role of the mixed selectivity

First, neuron responses are **repeatable** which means that they behave the same during the same context but their behavior change in a different context. On the contrary to those multitasking neurons, there are **pure selective** ones

## Mixed selectivity simplify the readout

For pure selective neurons, their responses lies on a plane but the readout also requires to fit a plane. On the contrary, mixed neurons have their activity projected on a higher dimensional space (similar to SVM) but the readout lies on a simple line to differentiate any combinations

## Future directions

In addition to isolating brain regions involved in a task, it becomes important to also investigates **how** the information is encoded to identify complementarity between brain regions.
