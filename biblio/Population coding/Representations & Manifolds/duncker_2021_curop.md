- **How collective activity of neural populations give rise to complex behavior**?
	- *Hypothesis :* through the dynamical evolution of distributed activity in recurrent circuits
	- This #Review explains how to **model the dynamic of neural populations that lies in a low-dimensional** variable space


## Description

### Characterizing neural activity manifolds

- **Population state :** point in a high dimensional space where each dimension is the response of one neuron of a population (e.g. 10 neurons = 10D space)
- **Trajectory :** temporal path (i.e. consecutive states) drawn in high dimension
- **Manifold :** sometimes, several neurons from this population while behave the same (i.e. redundant coding). In that case, the trajectory will be confined in a lower-dimensional subset or *manifold*
