## Introduction
---

- Interactions are thought to be mainly #Redundant in the brain because scenes IRL present strong spatial correlation $\Rightarrow$ #Redundant 
- #EfficientCoding = It was proposed that the goal of sensory systems was to _decrease the redundancy of neuronal response_ (cf Barlow.). This reduction is usually performed by _removing correlations within a population_
- Correlation $\Leftrightarrow$ #Redundancy 

## Results
---

### Synergistic and Redundant Coding in Visual Cortex

- $\Delta I = I(AllNeurons_{Joint}) - \sum_{i} I(neuron_{i})$ 
	- If $\Delta I > 0 \Leftrightarrow$ #Synergy (~43% of neurons)
	- If $\Delta I < 0 \Leftrightarrow$ #Redundancy  (~47% of neurons)

### Synergy and Redundancy Hubs

- Identification of #Redundant and #Synergistic hubs (% of mostly #Redundant / #Synergistic interactions for each neuron)
- Hubs' clustering
	- *Syn-Syn* $\Rightarrow$ Syn
	- *Red-Red* $\Rightarrow$ Red
	- *Syn-Red* $\Rightarrow$ Undetermined

### Stimulus-Dependent Correlated Activity Gives Rise to Synergistic Interactions

- They used a framework called #InformationBreakdown to decompose $\Delta I = I^{SS} + I^{CI} + I^{CD}$ where :
	- $I^{ss} =$ Amount of red due to the similarity of neuronal responses
	- $I^{CI}/I^{CD} =$ Effect of correlation on information processing
