> [[@yuste2015neuron]] : Single neurons were considered as the fundamental unit in the brain. We are currently experiencing a switch in this doctrine since emerging functions appears from collective firing of neurons = neural networks

# Importance of single neuron
---
The more a system is highly interconnected, the less importance each unit is (i.e. the individual neuron)

## Example of emerging function
---
Take an image on the screen, it's impossible do understand what it represents from the isolated pixels. The meaning emerges as the result of the structural placement (i.e. connectivity) of all of the pixels

## Patterns of spontaneous activity
---
Functional reverberations (activity that persists after the stimulus presentation) could be the result of recurrent connections. **Recursive and reverberating patterns of neuronal activity could be responsible of generating functional states in the brain**. Said differently, we could have some a reservoir of **learned dynamic patterns of activity**.
