David Marr was a cognitive scientist who proposed a framework for understanding how intelligent systems, such as humans and machines, process information. He suggested that there are three levels of analysis that can be applied to any intelligent system:

1. **Computational Level:** This level describes *what the system does and why*. It involves understanding the goals of the system and the strategies it uses to achieve those goals. At this level, we are concerned with what information the system takes as input, how it processes that information, and what output it produces.
2. **Algorithmic Level:** This level describes *how the system accomplishes its goals*. It involves understanding the specific algorithms or procedures the system uses to transform the input into output. At this level, we are concerned with the specific operations and rules that the system employs.
3. **Implementation Level:** This level describes the *physical substrate that the system is built on*. It involves understanding the physical components of the system, such as the neurons in a brain or the transistors in a computer chip, and how those components are arranged to carry out the algorithms and computations that the system performs.

So, in simple terms, the three levels of David Marr are: what a system does and why (computational level), how it accomplishes its goals (algorithmic level), and the physical substrate that the system is built on (implementation level).
