#MutualInhibition #Definition

Mutual inhibition in neuroscience refers to a mechanism in which two or more neurons or neural circuits that are connected to each other inhibit each other's activity. This means that when one neuron or circuit becomes active, it will inhibit the activity of the other neuron or circuit, and vice versa.  
  
Mutual inhibition is a common mechanism in many neural circuits and can have various functions. For example, it can be involved in controlling the timing of movements or in selecting between different sensory inputs. In these cases, the mutual inhibition between different neural circuits allows for precise and selective control over behavior.  
  
In summary, mutual inhibition is a mechanism in which neurons or neural circuits inhibit each other's activity, and it plays an important role in many neural processes, including motor control and sensory processing
