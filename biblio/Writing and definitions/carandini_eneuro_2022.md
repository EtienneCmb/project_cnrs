> [!INFO]
> **How to write scientific papers:**
> - Write **simple** and **brief** in **American Englinsh**
> - Impenetrable paragraph: finish sentences with **new informations**

## Section-by-section
---

- **Introduction:** Ask questions in the context of the litterature
- **Results:** Answer the questions
- **Discussion:** Discuss your results

### Introduction

> [!INFO]
> - Write **simple** and **brief** (~500 words)
> - Identify **key questions**
> - Use **topic sentence** with structure
> - Write in paragraph (unit of science)

- **1st paragraph:**
	- Presentation of the *broad area of inquiry*
	- Start with a *punchline*
- One paragraph / one question?
- **Last paragraph**
	- Description of the *main results*
	- Mention methods if novel / sexy

### Results

> [!INFO]
> - Include brief **methodological details**
> - Impenetrable paragraph: finish sentences with **new informations

- **1st paragraph**
	- Brief *roadmap of how results are organized*
	- Can also summarize methods apply to whole study (e.g. task and recordings)
- **Subsections**
	- Same name as the figure

### Discussion

> [!INFO]
> - Discussion= **draw conclusions**
> - Conclusions are at a **higher-level** (i.e. how the brain works)
> - Many people don't read the discussion: **story should be understandable from intro and results**
> - Rest of the discussion should return to the questions raised in the introduction

## General tips
---
### Style

> [!INFO]
> - Be as **simple** and **brief** as possible
> - **Cut needless words** (go through each word and ask yourself whether cutting a word changes the meaning) (e.g. remove respectively, recent, very etc.)
> - Write in **active voice** (17 subjects performed the task > the task was performed by 17 subjects)
> - **Avoid synonyms** (ensure readers will put minimal efforts)

### Sentences

> [!INFO]
> **Impenetrable paragraph:**
> - A sentence **begins with previous information and ends with new informations**

### Paragraphs

> [!INFO]
> - **One paragraph = one idea**
> - **Topic sentence:** First sentence of a new paragraph *summarizes the topic of the paragraph*
> - **Bold the topic sentence** while preparing the manuscript
> - **Assert and justify:** assert the idea and justify based on the results

**Topic sentences:**
- Readers can skip paragraph based on this first sentence
- If it is hard to summarize a paragraph with this topic sentence then it means that there are several ideas within the same paragraph. *Split the paragraph*
- The abstract is the *concatenation of the topic sentences*

### Figures

> [!INFO]
> - **Figures should tell the whole story** (think about students doing journal clubs)
> - Figures are the support not the subject of the research

### Numbers

> [!INFO]
> - Numbers interrupt the flow of reading
> - Try to **move numbers to captions and methods** (p-values, confidence intervals etc.)
> - Decrease level of precision (e.g. 61.37% -> 61%)
