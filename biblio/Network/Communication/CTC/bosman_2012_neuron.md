> [[@bosman2012attentional]] : Stimulus selection (i.e. attention) is selected by inter-areal synchronization

## Description
---
- The task is the [[far_close_task#Close condition]] where the two stimuli are presented in the bottom right corner of the screen. In a first condition, they present _each stimulus individually_ and in an other condition, _the two stimuli are presented together_.
- They focused their analyses 300ms after cue onset (i.e. when fixation point changed color) up to when the stimulus changed shape (randomized timing up to 4.5s)
- ECoG data in two monkeys. Grids are covering occipital, parietal such as some frontal areas. Here, they focused on inter-areal relations within the occipital lobe (V1 and V4). Inside V1, they used stimulus-specific sites (V1a and V1b)
- Visual presentation of _Stimulus A_ triggered a gamma response in V1a (red) and visual presentation of _Stimulus B_ triggered a gamma response in V1b (blue). V4 gamma responded to both _Stimulus A and B_. They found a natural existing coherence between V1a-V4 and V1b-V4 that is existing only for its specific stimulus.
- When both stimuli were presented, attention to the behaviorally relevant stimulus triggered gamma responses in V1a, V1b and V4. However, **the coherence between V1a-V4 was only remaining for Stimulus A and coherence between V1b-V4 was only remaining for Stimulus B**. ==Mind blowing !==
-  They also found stronger bottom-up GC (i.e. $V1 \rightarrow V4$) compared to top-down GC

_(A to F) the stimulus are presented separately. They used this to show that V1a and V1b are stimulus-specific. (G to L) stimuli are presented together_

## Open questions

> - What happen in the rest of the brain? Can we found elsewhere, in other frequency bands the existence of pairwise stimulus specificity?
> - Can higher-order interactions increase the stimulus specificity?
