> [[@rohenkohl2018gamma]]: The phase relation (PPC) between V1-V4 preceding stimulus change can already predict monkey's reaction time. The closer the PPC to the mean phase, the sorter the RT

## Description

- They used the [[far_close_task#Far condition]]
- Window of analysis focused in the **200ms preceding the stimulus change**
- They retrieved the gamma peak in the power spectra such as in the PPC spectra
- They found a (circular) correlation between RT and Pairwise Phase Consistency (PPC) that started 300ms before stimulus changed and stopped 100ms after stimulus changed
- Finally, they found that when the phase difference was closer to the mean phase, this led to shorter RT and the further away from this mean phase, the longer the RTs
