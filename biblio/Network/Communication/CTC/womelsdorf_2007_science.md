## Highlights

> [[@womelsdorf2007modulation]] : Inter-sites power-to-power increase when trials aligned around the mean (i.e. good) phase. Phase relation could potentially be a mechanism to weight long range interactions.

## Description

- LFP and MUA in monkeys and cats
- Power correlation between distant sites is modulated as a function of the phase. Good phase (i.e. closed to the across-trials mean) involves an increase in power correlation
- It seems that there's a causal relation between phase alignment and power correlation. Indeed, phase relation are preceding power correlation

_Good phase = Mean phase and power-to-power increase as a function of phase difference_

## Open questions

> **If gamma power correlates with PE in the PFC, and there are information transfer, is it possible that the phase difference is actually the source modulating power according to PE?**
