## Highlights

> [[@buehlmann2010optimal]] : Information also increase when trials aligned around the mean (i.e. good) phase. This could be a potential mechanism for source-to-target information routing decision.

# Description

- This paper is follow-up paper to [[@womelsdorf2007modulation]] but instead of looking at power-to-power correlation as a function of phase difference, they looked at information transfer
- They used a model
- Similarly, they found that the difference of phase shapes also the information transfer. The closer to the mean phase, the more efficient the information transfer (in amplitude and speed)

## Open question

> **The information transfer, is it because of the phase or the amplitude? Not clear to me.**
