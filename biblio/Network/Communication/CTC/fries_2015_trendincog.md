## Highlights

> [[@fries2005mechanism]] : CTC proposes that communication between distant neural group is weighted by their coherence (or phase-locking). The communication occurs only if their respective windows are opened at the same time

## Description

- Previous work proposed that neuronal communication for supported only by anatomical connections (fixed). However, information routing has to be flexible to adapt to the variety of cognitive demand changes
- #Fries proposed that the communication between distant neural groups is subserved by neuronal coherence (i.e. phase-locking between oscillators)
- Neural groups can only interact effectively if oscillations are coherent i.e. their communication windows are opened at the same time. Otherwise there's no communication
- There are neurophysiological evidences that a message is massively transmitted if the neuron in the sending group organize themself to bundle their spikes into burst
- The role of the frequency bands for the CTC is not very clear. For sure, there's $\gamma$ coherence within-roi and coherence in lower-frequencies for distant roi (e.g. $\beta$)

## Open questions

> - The role of the frequency band is not clear
> - Is there a link between the neuronal timescales and CTC?
