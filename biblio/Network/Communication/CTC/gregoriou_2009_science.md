> [[@gregoriou2009high]] : Coherence between FEF-V4 increases with attention. FEF is exerting a top-down influence on V4 with a delay between [8, 13]ms

## Description


- Similar task as Pascal Fries' one - **covert attention task**
- They are recording MUA and LFP in two monkeys in the FEF and V4
- FEF and V4 have **reciprocal anatomical connections**. Electrical stimulation in FEF induce neuron response in V4. In addition, neurons in the FEF are also discharging respectively to the spatial localization of the stimulus. Said differently, FEF and V4 have receptive fields (RF). That's why they recorded FEF and V4 neurons with shared RF
- FEF neurons start discharging before (80ms) V4 neurons
- They found stronger gamma coherence between FEF and V4 and this coherence was stronger for the stimulus in the RF. They also found a frequency-invariant delays between 8-13ms
- $GC_{FEF \rightarrow V4}$ started earlier (~110ms) than $GC_{V4 \rightarrow FEF}$ (~160ms)
