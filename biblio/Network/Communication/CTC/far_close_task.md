# Far vs. Close condition of the visuo spatial task
#Fries #FriesTask #VisuoSpatialTask #FarCondition #CloseCondition

---

First, the ECoG data are recorded in the **left hemisphere**. In the _Close Condition_, the two stimuli (yellow and blue circles with black strips) are closed to each other (e.g. bottom right corner of the screen). This mean that **both stimuli are going to produce a response in the V1 of the left hemisphere**. In the _Far Condition_, the two stimuli are presented respectively in the top left corner and in the bottom right corner.  **This means that only the stimuli in the bottom right corner is going to produce a response in the V1 left**.
