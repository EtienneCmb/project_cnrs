> [[@siegel2015cortical]] : investigated how sensory, task and choice-related information are encoded in frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes by looking at spiking activity in monkeys. Here, they are talking about information flow but actually it's more related to the onset time of encoding and delays between regions in encoding time.

## Highlights

- **Bottom-Up flow for sensory / task informations :** they found that encoding of information first arrived in visual / temporal areas followed by frontal regions
- **Top-Down flow for choice information :** conversely, they found encoding onset of choice in PFC and then in lower-order areas

## Open questions
### Widely distributed encoding

Task-related information is encoded everywhere in almost every regions tested. However, it's not clear if the encoding is the same (i.e. if the information encoded is redundant between brain regions, if the regions are really encoding the same features etc.)

### Delayed encoding

First, I'm not sure we can talk about "information flow" here since there's no conditioning on the past. It's only "delayed encoding". Now, there's two possibilities : 
1. there's no information flow, it's just that each region activates one after the other 
2. there's is an information flow. In the second case, can we say that the region really encodes features after receiving inputs from different regions or is the region "on the same road" of the source? Not clear...
