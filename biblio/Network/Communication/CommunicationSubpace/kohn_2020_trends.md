## Highlights
---

> [!INFO]
> - They provide a pretty good review of the possible mechanisms for communication
> - They promote their idea of #CommunicationSubspace i.e. instead of investigating the strength of interareal interactions, we should focus on how neurons are interacting (cf. [[semedo_curop_2020.png]])

## Description
---

### Cortico-cortical interactions

- **(A) Temporal coordination**
	- Neurons integrate synaptic inputs over a small-time window
	- Synchronous input neurons are more likely to generate a response in target neurons than asynchronous inputs
	- There's a synchronization between input and output neurons
	- *Pitfall :* this synchrony-based of communication is not very likely because there's in general a *weak temporal synchrony*
- **(B) CTC**
	- Interareal communication is more effective when the *oscillations in the source and target* areas are synchronized
- **(C) Communication subspace**
	- A source population adapts its scheme to match the communication "channel" of the target population (like a *lock-and-key*)
	- Patterns could also be modulated according to attention, stimulus, behavior etc.

### Beyond interaction strength

- Most studies are investigating strength of interactions and how they differ between conditions
- They propose that it might be the time to investigate *how different scheme might contribute to function*
- Below, the list of properties that could be investigated
