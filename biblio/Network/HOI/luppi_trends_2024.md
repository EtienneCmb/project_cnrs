# Information decomposition and the informational architecture of the brain

---

> [!tip] Highlights
> This review discusses #Redundancy and #Synergy in resting state networks, cognition and evolution

- #InformationDynamics = information storage, transfer and modification

## Definitions of integration
---
Two possible definitions of #Integration :
1. **Acting as one :** many neurons starting acting in the same way $\Rightarrow$ *increase redundancy*
2. **Cooperation :** elements are complementary $\Rightarrow$ combining them provides an advantage $\Rightarrow$ *increase synergy*

## Information transfer and PID
---

#InformationTransfer can be linked to PID terms. It's not only the unique information from the past of $X$ to the future of $Y$, there's also some synergistic information 

## Emergence of redundancy and synergy in the human brain
