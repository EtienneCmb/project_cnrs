> [!INFO]
> Empirical evidences for cortico-striatal (i.e. M1/S1-striatum) $\gamma$ synchronization through $\theta-\gamma$ PAC and $\theta$-phase synchronization using rodent data during rest and movements

<br>

## Description
---

- Recordings in M1/S1 and in the striatum
- **Peak in the power spectrum :** in the $\theta$ and $\gamma$ ranges
- **PAC between $theta-\gamma$ :** in the cortex and in the striatum
- **Phase-Phase synchronization in the $\theta$ band**
