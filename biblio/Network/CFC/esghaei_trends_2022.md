## Highlights
---

```
CFC might plays different roles depending on whether it's intra- or inter-areal. 
```


## Description
---
The idea that is interesting for me is the figure bellow where they propose that in associative regions like the PFC, it receives projections from the ventral and dorsal streams and the PAC might be the mechanism to make the difference between the two.
