## Description

### Types of CFC

- **Phase-Frequency Coupling** (PFC)
- **Phase-Phase Coupling** ( #PPC )
- **Phase-Amplitude Coupling** ( #PAC )
- **Amplitude-Amplitude Coupling** ( #AAC )

### LFP properties

- **Frequency of an LFP oscillation :** frequency of average spiking of local populations
- **Power of an LFP oscillation :** degree to which neural spiking engage in a global oscillation. Can be induced by two phenomenons :
	- *Larger fraction of neurons engaged*
	- *Phase dispersion of spiking* (i.e. increase synchronization)

### CFC for inter-areal communication

- **Variant 1 :** improved communication through *phase synchronization*
	- In-phase inter-areal communication is thought to reflect *more efficient communication*
	- *Fast oscillations ($\gamma$)* = local
	- *Slow-oscillations (<10hz)* = may synchronize distant areas
	- Here, to synchronize the γ at long-distance, they say that there's a *coherence between slow oscillation* with *m:n Phase-Phase Coupling* between slow and fast oscillations
- **Variant 2 :** improved communication between regions with *gamma jointly active within similar slow oscillation phase*
	- Here, the PAC is used instead of the PPC

They also provide an example for distant gamma synchronization in  the rodent hippocampus through theta phase.
