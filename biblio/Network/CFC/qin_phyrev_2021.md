## Highlights
---

> [!INFO]
> They build a model using oscillators to show that it's possible to create PAC to synchronize long-range gamma power via phase-phase synchronization and also to control the **direction of the information flow**

## Description
---

- Ref showing that *distinct frequencies are not independent* and instead, interact (like PAC)
- **Example :** correlation between the $\gamma$ rhythm between the cortex and the striatum is mediated by $\theta$-phase synchronization with $\theta-\gamma$ PAC (see [[nicolai_jon_2014]])
