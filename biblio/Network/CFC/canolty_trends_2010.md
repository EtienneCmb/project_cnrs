## Description
---

- Low frequency oscillations are *entrained both by external sensory inputs and internal cognitive events*
- Different rhythms are associated with different *spatial scales* and *different cell population sizes*
- Functional role of CFC :
	- **Phase-Phase Coupling ( #PPC )** : mechanism of communication & linking activity that occurs at different rates
	- **Amplitude-Amplitude Coupling ( #AAC )** : correlates with behavior but other than that, not clear !
	- **Phase-Amplitude Coupling ( #PAC )** : long-range $\gamma$-synchronization and many other functional roles
- Origin of the components :
	- *Low-frequency phase* : reflects local neuronal excitability (i.e. the threshold to reach to cause a spike)
	- *High-frequency power :* either a general increase in population synaptic activity (=broad-band gamma) or selective activation of a sub-network (=narrow-band gamma)
- #PredictiveCoding : `the purpose of the brain is to guide action, and perception and cognition arose as error correction mechanisms to adjust and optimize an actively ongoing process of action selection`
- **How dynamic entertainment of low-frequency phase changes local computations and long-range communication :**
	- LFP phase modulates the *instantaneous spike probability* and can also *shift spiking in time* $\rightarrow$ shift of the local $\gamma$?
	- Low-frequency coherence seems to be important for the *coordination of large-scale networks* through phase-locking
