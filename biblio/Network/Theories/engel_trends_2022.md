## Highlights
---

> [!INFO]
> - #FC measures pairwise associations
> - It's not clear whether coupling **play a causal role** (i.e. has a functional relevance) or if it's just a consequence of #SC and other properties
> - **There's not proof for the causal role of functional coupling**

## Description
---
- **Intrinsic coupling modes :** ( #ICMs) an emerging _intrinsic_ pattern of coupling (i.e. that is not triggered by external stimulation)
- **Phase ICMs**
	- *Hypothesis :* Phase ICMs might enable *specific communication* between separate neuronal populations during stimulus or cognitive processing
	- Might servers for information #Integration, information routingof relevant information (cf. #Fries for attention)
- **Amplitude ICMs**
	- *Hypothesis :* Amplitude ICMs might represent coupled excitability fluctuations for the recruiting task-relevant neural populations
- **Testing the causal role of #FC** : the putative causal of neural interactions should be tested with specific manipulations (i.e. *multi-sites stimulation*) of neural populations 
	- Optogenetics
	- Stimulation
