> [[@varela2001brainweb]] : cognitive functions emerge from the synchronization (e.g. PLV) of specialized sub-networks. Large integration probably occurs because of dynamic networks in specific frequencies.

## Description
---

### Network structure

1. **Within area** reciprocal connections for specialized computations or **Between areas** if they behave the same (i.e. the belong to the same _level_)
2. For **across levels**, links are directed (i.e. #FeedForward and #FeedBack connections)

Sub-networks exist for small amount of time = #DynamicNetworks

_Segregation into to sub-networks linked by reciprocal connections for large scale integration_

## Large-scale integration mediated by synchronization

> **Large-scale integration mediated by synchronization**

Different scales :
- **Local scale :** generally ~1cm with conduction delays of _4-6ms_
- **Large scale :** > 1cm with conduction delays of _8-10ms_ (e.g. frontal-occipital is ~12ms)

> Best scale for investigating such type of events is the **mesoscale** because cognitive events happens around ==~100-300ms==. Hence, #LFP is particularly relevant since we lose the **specificity of each neuron** but we gain their **common action**.

## Open questions
---
1. Coherence exists within **multiple frequency bands**. 
	1. It's not clear what's the _role of the frequencies_?
	2. How _frequencies talk to each others_?  It requires #CrossFrequency #FC measurements
	3. They suggest that $\beta$ coherence serves for **long-range** communications (~10-50ms transmission delays) while $\gamma$ coherence for **short-range**. Slower oscillation (i.e. $\delta$, $\theta$ and $\alpha$) could serve as **temporal framing of cognitive events** (i.e. when it starts and when it finishes)
