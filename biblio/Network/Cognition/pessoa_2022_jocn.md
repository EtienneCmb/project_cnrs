### Emergence
#definition

 The term `emergence` comes from the chemistry in 1870 where unpredictable properties from the combination of elements

> **Emergence :** a collective property that is observed when multiple elements interact and that can not be predicted by the function of the individual constituants.

### Brain organization

#### Anatomical connectivity

- Most of the connections are **local** (i.e. 1.5-2.5mm, ~70%) combined to a **modest amount of long-range** connections
- The cortex does **not has a "small-world" structure because there's to much connections between nodes**
- Still, there are hubs in all lobes that massively connect to other cortical areas
- **Basal-Ganglia-cortical loop** (BG-cortical loop) _The entire cortex project to the striatum and loop back to the cortex via the thalamus_. Hence, we should not only look at cortico-cortical interactions.

#### Distributed functional coordination

- Anatomy **constraint** the function
- The relation between **structure-function** is hard to establish considering _bidirectional connections_, _loops_, _excitation_, _inhibition_ and _non-linearity_

#### Networks as functional units

- Field switched from the neuron, to the population and now to the _network_ as the functional unit
- Some regions adapt their #FC with other regions depending on the task
- Hence, **the computations performed by a region depend on the network its included in**.

## Open questions

### Heterarchy

#definition
> **Heterarchy :** instead of investigating hierarchical relations, the _heterarchy_ supposes that information is sent to multiple directions at once. It doesn't mean that there's no organization behind !

### New arising questions

- Old to new form questions : 
	- _how a property is locally encoded in a region?_ $\rightarrow$ **how the property emerges from decentralized coordination ?** 
	- _how information is passed from region to region?_ = _how regions decodes the signal of other regions_ $\rightarrow$  **how coordinated activity of multiregion assemblies generates signals with specific properties ?**
