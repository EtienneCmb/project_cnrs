# Geometric constraints on human brain function
Pang, Fornito, _Nature_, 2023

---

## Highlights
---

> [!INFO]
> - Brain functions are contrained by anatomy
> - It was previously thought that #SC (i.e. #Connectome ) was the main constraints
> - This article proposes that the geometry of the brain might actually represents a more fundamental constraints on brain functions than the #SC 

- To demonstrate their point, they compared the predicting performance of the #FC using either the #SC either using the geometry
