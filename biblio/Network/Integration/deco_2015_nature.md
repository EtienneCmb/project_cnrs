> [!INFO]
> - Computational modelling (i.e. model fitting that encompasses both #SC and #FC)
> - Once fitted, this model can be used to ask questions on how the system would react to *perturbations*

## Description
---

### Introduction

- Flexible cognition could be achieved through balancing between #Integration and #Segregation , with dynamic changes over time
- **Integrated information =** information the system has. This quantity of information exceed the sum of the amount of information of its parts 

### Definitions

- **Perturbational segregation**
	- Capacity of the brain to *convey* the amount of information provided by external inputs
	- It's like looking at the spatial spreading provoked by a perturbation
	- Kind of "mutual information between proximal voxels"
- **Perturbational integration**
	- Measure the efficacy of the brain to integrate the information instead of looking at the travel of the information
