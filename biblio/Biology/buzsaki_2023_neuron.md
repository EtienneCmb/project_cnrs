## Discharge of downstream neurons
---

- Action potentials of upstream neurons have to co-occur inside a time window = **membrane time constant** ($\tau$). For example, $\tau=10-50ms$ for a pyramidal neuron, which corresponds to #Gamma rhythm. It's a combined action (or cooperation) since they all contribute to the discharge of the downstream neuron
- In the brain, most structures are bidirectionally connected and can serve as senders or receivers

## Brain rhythm as a neural code
---

- Oscillations are based on **inhibition** $\Rightarrow$ creates temporal frames *chunking neuronal spiking activity into cell assemblies*
- Many rhythm + CFC $\Rightarrow$ extension of code
- One over f power spectrum:
	- Slow oscillations $\Rightarrow$ longer membrane time constant $\Rightarrow$ include a larger number of neurons (larger neuronal volume) $\Rightarrow$ more #Global
	- Fast oscillations $\Rightarrow$ smaller membrane time constant $\Rightarrow$ include a smaller number of neurons (smaller neuronal volume) $\Rightarrow$ more #Local
- Consequently, #CFC represents local-global coordination (cf. Bassett)
