## Recording from the extracellular medium

Neuronal activity gives rise to transmembrane currents that can be recorded in the extracellular medium (i.e. outside of the neuron, in contrast to the patch-clamp for example)

## Contributors to the LFP signal

Contributors to the LFP signal :

- **Synaptic activity :** most important source of extracellular current flow, the synaptic activity has a major contribution to the LFP signal
- $Na^{+}$ **and** $Ca^{2+}$ : mainly contribute to the high-frequency components of the LFP
- **Intrinsic currents ad resonance :** some neurons have a resonance properties i.e. they fire more efficiently when inputs are presented within a specific frequency range. Some prefer within the theta range and others like interneurons in the gamma range.
- **Others :** I think others have a minor influence
- **One-over-f property :** the $1/f^{n}$ of the LFP signal has several origins. First, dendrites have a low-pass filtering property. When high-frequency inputs are presented to the dendrites, can be detected in the extracellular medium but is attenuated near 100 times near the soma. 1Hz inputs are less attenuated. The extracellular medium itself could have some properties contributing to the $1/f^{n}$. Finally, there's also a network contribution : during a long temporal window, more neurons can be recruited hence more neurons contribute to the LFP signal while in shorter time windows less neurons can be recruited.
- **Inverse problem :** since the LFP has several contributors, the same macroscopic extracellular signal can be produced by different cellular events. For example, the theta in the hippocampus and in cortical regions might emerge because of different microscopic events.
- **Spike contribution to the LFP :** important implication of spike activity to the LFP :
	1. Increase spiking, spiking frequency and synchrony increase the spectral power mainly in the high-frequency range. Hence, _gamma activity can be considered as an index or proxy of spiking synchrony_.
	2. Phase-locked spiking neurons generate rhythmic extracellular currents. This means that _gamma activity can be phase-locked to low-frequency oscillations_


> **Gamma activity can be considered as a proxy to assess or evaluate neuronal outputs. It can be used to link the macroscopic level of the sEEG / EEG with the microscopic-level of spiking activity of neuronal assemblies**
