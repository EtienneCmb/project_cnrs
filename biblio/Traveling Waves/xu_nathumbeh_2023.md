# Interacting spiral wave patterns underlie complex brain dynamics and are related to cognitive processing
Xu et al., _Nature Human Behavior_, 2023

## Highlights
---

> [!INFO]
> - Existence of spiral, rotational waves during resting state and cognition. The waves are organized around phase singularities($\Phi = 0$)
> - Modulation of #TW properties (direction and locations) according to cognition
> - Characterization of the interactions between waves
> - They propose that it can quickly be used for flexible behavior


## Introduction
---
- Most of the biblio focused on zero-phase interactions (i.e. aligned on time)

## Results
---
### Resting state

- Singularities closed to functional boundaries
- Amplitude decreases with distance from singularity
- Interactions between #TW:
	- *Full annihilation:* transient planar wave travelling perpendicular to the axis formed by the spiral pair
	- *Partial annihilation:*
	- _Repulsion :_
### Cognition

- **Location and rotation direction change at the single-trial level and can be used to classify cognitive tasks**
