# Link between criticality and redundancy/synergy
---
- System goes from ordered ($\approx$ redundant) to chaotic ($\approx$ synergy)
- The brain operates at a slightly subcritical level (quasicriticality)
- Hence, it's slightly more redundant

> - **How this quasicriticality translates in terms of proportion between redundancy/synergy?**
