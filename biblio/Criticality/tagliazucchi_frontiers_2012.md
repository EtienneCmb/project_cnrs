Tagliazucchi, Chialvo, _Frontiers in physiology_, 2012

## Highlights
---

> [!INFO]
> - Authors investigated #Criticality using #fMRI data
> - #PointProcess : divide time-series by their standard deviation and then use 1SD for thresholding
> - Discretized time-series showed similar resting-state networks compared continuous time-series
