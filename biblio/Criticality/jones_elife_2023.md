## Highlights
---

> [!INFO]
> 1. Scale-free in the behavior
> 2. Scale-free in the neural activity
> 3. Correlation between scale-free behavior and neuronal activity
> 4. Highest correlations achieved for neurons with highest power-law scaling
> 5. Not all neurons show power laws
> 6. Consequence of 5., power laws over all neurons might not show up because of this mix


> the theory of #CracklingNoise , which explains a broad class of stick-slip critical phenomena (Sethna et  al., 2001), predicts that the size power-law exponent τ and the duration power-law exponent α should be related to how size scales with duration. More specifically, $S(T) \sim T^{β}$  where $β_{crackling} = (α - 1)/(τ –1)$. Many previous observations of scale-free neural activity support this prediction with values of $β_{crackling}$ ≈ 1.1–1.3
