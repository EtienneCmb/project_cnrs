# The cortex and the critical point


## The main idea
---


> [!INFO]
> **Criticality hypothesis** : when a network of neurons collectively interact near a critical phase transition it optimize multiple information processing functions. This drives to two consequences: 1) #ScaleFree properties and 2) #Universality


## Properties near critical point

![[Pasted image 20231006160445.png]]

- **System near the critical point**: Inputs don't die too quickly (first row) or there's no "explosion" (last row), but basically, the **number of activated neurons at each time step stays relatively stable**. Several consequences of this stability:
	1. *Optimal information processing:* because encoded features at $t_{0}$ can be retrieved at $t_{N}$
	2. *Spatio-temporal persistence:* relevant information can travel longer in time and further in space because of 1.
	3. *Power law:* $Criticality \Rightarrow PowerLaw$ but the existence of a power law doesn't imply that the system is near the critical point. A power law on time means that shorter events are very frequents, while long events are rare. Importantly, **power laws mean that short and long (or small / big) events coexist**. This is due to 2. because near critical point, information stays longer in the system which implies that events can coexist.
	4. *Avalanches:* when events are distributed according to power laws, we call them #Avalanche 
	5. *Phase transition:* before to after the critical point, the system transits from order to disorder (or active to inactive)


## Emergent phenomena

### Properties


> [!danger] Emergent phenomena
> - **From low higher scale :** Arise at a *larger scale* than its constituents
> - **Interactions are key**: Depends on the *interactions* between constituents
> - **Properties of emergent phenomena**: *(i)* differ from its constituents, *(ii)* hard to predict based on those of its constituents
> - **Independence** : many parameters of the constituents have no causal influence on the emergent phenomena
> - **Downward causation**: while having *no mass*, emerging phenomena can then causally influence their constituents

Examples of emerging phenomena:
- #TW #TravelingWaves 
- #Synchronization  #CTC #Coherence 
- #Oscillation  #LFP 
- #Patterns #Avalanche 

### Approaching emergent phenomena

#### Hypothesis

> [!INFO]
> **Hypothesis** : to understand emerging phenomena (e.g. #TW , #Oscillation  ), we need to understand the critical point. However, emerging phenomena fall apart when we try to study parts of the system in isolation ( #Reductionism ). Therefore, he suggests that we need to understand the interactions between elements.

#### How to study emergent phenomena


> [!ERROR]
> - **Interactions in highly sampled space**: record and study as many constituents as possible and focus on their interactions (i.e. connectivity). If possible, manipulate interactions.
> - **Make a phase diagram**: constructs a phase diagram to observe the dynamic of the transition from order to disorder (oscillations to non-oscillatory signals). Not clear how to do it...


## The critical point
---

### Definitions

- **Control parameter :** the parameter to tune to make the system transition from a stable / ordered state to unstable / chaotic state
- **First order phase transition :** non-continuous transition from ordered to chaotic states
- **Second order phase transition :** smooth and continuous phase transition from ordered to chaotic states
- **Scale-free :** in case of power-laws, the ratio of probabilities of two events only depends on the exponent, not the size of the events (e.g. $P(Size_{10})/P(Size_{1})=P(Size_{10000})/P(Size_{10000})$)
- **Universality:** near critical point, all systems operate in the same ways
- **Quasicriticality:** the brain seems to operate at a slightly subcritical state, with a branching ratio slightly below 1

### Signature of being near critical point

> [!ERROR]
> - **What comes in, comes out :** : Branching ratio (i.e. $\approx Number_{in}/Number_{out}$) is closed to 1
> - **Control parameter :** there's a parameter that can be tuned to transition the system from an ordered to a chaotic state
> - **Power laws :** power laws appear and therefore scale-free behaviors
> - **Universality :** universal laws also appear (for example, scaling functions can be applied to short and long events and they superimposed perfectly)
